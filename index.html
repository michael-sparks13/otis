				On Saturday, October 14, 2023, meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center in Miami put out an
				innocuous <a

				several hundred miles south of Mexico, a low-pressure system, which plays a crucial role in storm
				development, was
				beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean. A tropical depression, the outlook said, “is expected to form
				during the latter
				part of next week while the system meanders well offshore of the coast of Mexico.”

			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">
				That tropical depression did form. But what was expected to meander well offshore eventually rammed
				directly into
				Acapulco as the strongest storm to ever hit Mexico’s western coast and, ultimately, the most expensive
				storm to ever hit
				anywhere in Mexico.

				A <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL096126" target="_blank">recent
					study</a> by researchers out of Stanford found that, as the climate warms, weather prediction
				becomes more error-prone. Otis is a
				case study of the difficulty of forecasting storms in the climate crisis era. It is also a sad tale of
				the devastation
				of Acapulco and the long road to recovery ahead.
			</p>
			<p class="article-graf">The storm did not strike without warning. Acapulco, and almost all coastal portions
				of Mexico’s Guerrero state, were
				under a hurricane watch by 3 pm on Monday the 23rd. What was completely unexpected was “how quickly and
				how much Otis
				would intensify,” said Dr. Jeff Masters, a prominent author on extreme weather and former hurricane
				scientist with NOAA.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">
				A direct hit on Acapulco is a historical rarity. Although the city sits in a prime tropical cyclone
				climate–latitude 17
				degrees north and near typically warm water–the easterly winds that prevail at this latitude tend to
				drive storms west,
				roughly parallel to the coast but far enough not to be a threat to land. Tropical Storm Claudia, which
				landed in 1973,
				is the only storm on record as having made landfall within 50 miles of Acapulco. “There are no
				hurricanes on record even
				close to this intensity for this part of Mexico,” said the National Hurricane Center in a public release
				less than six
				hours before Otis landed.

			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">
				Accordingly, in the days leading up to landfall, prominent forecast models projected Otis to remain
				offshore, mirroring
				typical hurricane behavior for the region. But part of what makes Otis historic is exactly its
				ahistorical behavior.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">
				Compounding the forecasting challenge was a lack of data particular to southern Mexico and the eastern
				Pacific.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">When the first, and only, Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane flew into Otis to conduct
				direct observation, the NHC had
				only classified Otis as a category one storm, relying primarily on satellite imagery to do so. In
				reality, the Hurricane
				Hunter team observed that Otis was already a category three: a major hurricane.</p>

			<p class="article-graf">The Hurricane Hunter mission reached Otis around 1 pm on Tuesday. At 10 pm that
				night, the NHC released a notice saying
				“A nightmare scenario is unfolding for southern Mexico this evening.” Otis, we now know, was in the
				midst of a process
				called “extremely rapid intensification,” defined by an increase in wind speed of at least 58 mph within
				24 hours. Otis
				blew past that definition, strengthening by 115 mph in 24 hours. This put it behind only one other
				eastern Pacific storm
				for the most rapid intensification on record: 2015’s Hurricane Patricia, which strengthened by 120 mph
				in a day. Otis
				would peak at 165 mph and make landfall at 160 mph.</p>

			<!-- wind chart -->
			<div id="wind-chart">
				<img id="wind-graph" src="images/hurricane_winds.png" alt="chart of wind speeds" />
			</div>


			<p class="article-graf">Throughout its life, Otis was persistently stronger than the NHC was able to
				estimate. Dr. Masters told me that had the
				storm occurred in the Atlantic, that might not have been the case: “Only one Hurricane Hunter flight
				made it into Otis.
				Had Otis been in the Atlantic, at least three flights would have gone in, including one during the time
				period before RI
				started. The data from this early flight would have gone into the forecast models, potentially resulting
				in a much
				better forecast.” In addition, he said, there were no land-based radars in Mexico that observed Otis; if
				the storm had
				been approaching the U.S., data from the dense network of radars would have been available and used to
				make better model
				forecasts.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">The NHC echoed this in its formal storm report on the hurricane, stating, “The lack
				of observational data over the
				eastern Pacific Ocean can make intensity forecasting challenging in extreme RI cases, especially for
				small tropical
				cyclones like Otis…The in-situ datasets collected by the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters were
				crucial for
				forecasters to recognize that none of the models had an accurate representation of Otis’
				intensity…Unfortunately, the RI
				of Otis was well underway by the time these data were received."
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">Perhaps paradoxically for such a damaging storm, Otis was relatively quite small.
				Its hurricane-force winds extended
				only about 30 miles from its center. But it was this small size that reduced the amount of data points
				available to
				forecasters and was one of several obstacles that combined to make forecasting Otis very difficult.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">
				As part of its normal post-storm reports, the National Hurricane Center estimates a “best track” course
				that the storm
				likely took. It is clear from comparing that track with the forecasts released during the storm how
				difficult it was to
				forecast Otis in real-time. The best track’s color bands also show how Otis meandered north for hundreds
				of miles before
				escalating at a nearly unprecedented rate.

			<p class="article-graf">
				Any given weather event is the result of an almost limitless number of variables but, according to
				experts, two main
				factors led to the behavior Otis demonstrated.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">
				The first was a strong band of winds known as a “jet streak.” In layman’s terms, a jet streak is an
				extra fast band of
				winds flowing through a system that acts to ventilate the hurricane, “similar to when one ventilates a
				fire,” according
				to Dr. Masters. That warm air helped to supercharge the storm, much as oxygen does for a fire.
			</p>
			<p class="article-graf">
				That warm air didn’t act alone. The second critical factor in Otis’ extremely rapid intensification was
				higher than
				average sea surface temperatures. The eastern Pacific is already comparatively warm in the
				mid-latitudes, but October
				2023 was exceptional even by those standards. In some areas, the water was more than 3.6° Fahrenheit
				above average,
				pushing the overall temperature into the 90s.
			</p>
			<img id="sst-gif" src="images/sst3x.gif" alt="sst" />
			<p class="article-graf">
				“Hurricanes are heat engines that take heat energy from the oceans and convert it to the kinetic energy
				of wind. Thus,
				the more heat energy that is available in the ocean, the greater the maximum potential intensity of the
				hurricane,” Dr.
				Masters said.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">
				The NHC calculates that nearly 98% of homes and 80% of hotels in Acapulco suffered storm-related damage.
				UNICEF
				<a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/147326/file/Mexico-Hurricane-OTIS-SitRep-31-October-2023.pdf"
					target="_blank">cataloged</a> 120 hospitals and 33 schools among the damaged buildings. All told,
				the NHC estimates that Otis caused between $12-16
				billion worth of damage, making it the costliest Mexican hurricane ever.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">The utter devastation is evident from satellite images of a neighborhood in the
				heart of the city and a marina in Acapulco Bay.</p>

				Despite the extent of its impact, once it made landfall, Otis quickly dissipated. The NHC estimates it
				was only at
				hurricane strength for about 12 hours over land. Part of what drove the quick downscaling was the Sierra
				Madre del Sur
				mountain range, which abuts the city’s edge. Mountains act as barriers to airflow, disrupting the
				circulation patterns
				that sustain a tropical cyclone. Their rugged terrain can also increase friction near the storm’s
				surface, slowing down
				winds and further depleting the storm's energy, thus preventing it from moving further inland.
			</p>

			<p class="article-graf">
				That comes at a cost, though. Hurricanes bring not just strong wind, but also heavy rain. Acapulco saw
				nearly 11” of it.

					fatalities. All told, among landslides, flooding, and intense winds, the official death toll from
